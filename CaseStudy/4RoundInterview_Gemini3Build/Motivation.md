## Motivation:
Every new frontier model / agents launched, it’s my hiring time. :) With all the hype around Gemini3, I ALWAYS choose to trust my own interview process.

## The Setup

* Same PRD, Same Goal (Build a Gitcommit to Content web app) 
* Round 1: Start with the same instruction
* Round 2-4 : Increasing complexity. Ruthless feedback. Provide follow up feedbacks, ad_hoc requests etc. 

## Success Metric

Task completion rate  (include user flow completion + ad_hoc requests/feedback)
And the metrics in the critiera file.

## The Test Results:
- 🔴 Round 1: The “Oh No” Moment Honest truth? Gemini stumbled out of the gate. It missed a few basic steps.Meanwhile, Replit nailed it. Perfect execution.At this point, I thought the hype was overblown.

- 🟢 Rounds 2-4: The “Aha” Moment This is where Gemini 3 showed why people are excited.  *While Replit started to suffer from “Context Decay” (forgetting old instructions as the project got complex), Gemini woke up. It demonstrated the strong Long Context Agentic Reasoning and Context Coherence.*  With every round of feedback, it didn’t just fix errors—it reasoned. It connected the dots. By Round 4, it was handling massive context without breaking the existing flow. The Verdict:- Replit is a Sprinter. Perfect for “Zero to One” prototypes.- Gemini is a Marathon Runner. It starts slow, but it is Anti-Fragile. It gets smarter the more you talk to it.


## Fun fact: 
In this interview? Replit won the sprint. But Gemini won the job. And I hired new full time employee for design.
