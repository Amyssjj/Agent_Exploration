> **Role:** Professional Video Editor & Creative Director.
> **Task:** Create a stylized vertical (9:16) short film titled "Future Life Diaries" using the provided raw footage of service robots.
> **Aesthetic:** "Retro-Futurism." High-end editorial magazine meets Super 8 film.
> **Background:** consistently Deep Black (#000000) with subtle film grain texture.
>
> **Section 1: The Intro (0:00 - 0:05) - "The Bento Grid"**
> *   **Visual:** Arrange 3 different clips (Laundry Robot, Ping Pong Robot, Pet Robot) into a "Bento Box" collage layout. They should play simultaneously.
> *   **Style:** All clips must have rounded corners.
> *   **Title:** Overlay the title **"Future Life Diaries"** in the center.
> *   **Font:** Elegant Serif (e.g., Playfair Display or Garamond).
> *   **Effect:** Add a soft "Red Neon" outer glow to the white text.
>
> **Section 2: The Deep Dive (0:05 - 0:25) - "Solo Spotlight Frames"**
> *   **Transition:** Zoom *into* one of the grid boxes until it creates a "Solo Frame."
> *   **Layout:** The video clip sits in the center of the screen as a rounded rectangle (aspect ratio 4:5), floating in the black void (see reference style).
> *   **Content Sequence:**
>     1.  **Laundry Robot:** Show the robot handling clothes. **Text (Above Frame):** "Choreless Mornings."
>     2.  **Boxing/Ping Pong:** Cut to the robot playing. **Text (Below Frame):** "Always Game."
>     3.  **Pet Robot:** Close up of the robot dog. **Text (Above Frame):** "New Companions."
> *   **Text Style:** Keep the same Serif font with Red Glow. The text should appear in the black negative space (not covering the video).
>
> **Section 3: The Ending (0:25 - 0:30) - "The Re-Assembly"**
> *   **Visual:** The single "Pet Robot" frame zooms *back out*, and the other clips slide back in to reform the "Bento Grid" from the intro.
> *   **Final Text:** "Live Well with AI."
> *   **Effect:** The entire screen turns off like an old CRT TV (white horizontal line collapse) to black.
>
> **Visual enhancement:**
> 1.  **Texture:** Add a '35mm Film Grain' overlay to the entire video. The black background should not be pitch black, but a dark, grainy charcoal to mimic old film.
> 2.  **Typography:** Change the font color to **White** (#FFFFFF). Keep the **Red/Pink Neon Glow**, but increase the blur radius so it creates a soft halo behind the text. Ensure the font is a bold Editorial Serif (like Playfair Display Bold).
> 3.  **Transitions:** Apply a smooth 'Zoom In' transition when moving from the Intro Grid to the first Solo Clip.
> 4.  **Color Grade:** Boost the saturation of the robot clips slightly so they stand out against the dark background.
> 5.  **Ending:** Clean up the final 'TV Power Off' effect so it stays strictly inside the vertical 9:16 frame."
