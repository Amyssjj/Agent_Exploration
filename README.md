## Motivation

Reflecting on the transformative journey of artificial intelligence, I am profoundly
grateful to witness and participate in this revolution. Eager to learn and grow 
alongside the AI community, I am driven by curiosity about how AI can assist 
humanity and shape future directions. To bring my ideas to fruition, I plan to 
utilize various AI-powered tools to **build prototypes and turn concepts into reality**.

" The world is a very malleable place. If you know what you want, and you go for
it with maximum energy and drive and passion, the world will often reconfigure itself
around you much more quickly and easily than you would think." 

-- Marc Andreessen

## Agent Explorations

| Ideas               |  Notebook example                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Youtube Insights    | [From Natural Language to Key Insights: The 3-Steps YouTube Data Pipeline](Agent_Prototype/Agents/Agent_Youtube_Insights_Fetcher.ipynb)|
| Langfun Tutorials   | [Langfun for Langfun: Personalized tutorial Agent](Agent_Prototype/Agents/Agent_Langfun_Tutorial.ipynb)|
| Trip Planner        | [Multi-Agent Trip Planner](Agent_Prototype/Agents/MultiAgent_TripPlanner.ipynb)|

## Agent Prototype Components

This repository includes a structured prototype for building intelligent agents:

- `Agent_Prototype/`: Main directory containing all components
  - `Agents/`: Interactive notebooks demonstrating different agent capabilities
  - `Tools/`: Custom actions for Google Maps, Notion integration, search, and file operations
  - `Data/`: Example data and outputs from agents

## CLI Tools

| Tool | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| [ExplainClip](CLIs/explainclip/) | Production-quality animated explainer videos from the command line. An opinionated Manim toolkit with configurable themes, smart CN/EN font detection, glass overlays, and a full render pipeline. Works great with AI coding agents. |

## Tools Used

| Name               |  Why?                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| [Langfun](https://github.com/google/langfun/tree/main) | A must-have tool that introduces Object-Oriented Prompting, enabling the seamless integration of natural language and programming by treating language as functions—empowering users to build agents with ease.
