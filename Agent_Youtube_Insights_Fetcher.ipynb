It makes sense to me that something like &quot;226-68&quot; would activate neurons around 150-200, that&#39;s pretty similar to how humans can make a round about estimate before they start actually analyzing the question and calculating the answer to more accuracy.<br><br>I don&#39;t think we can ever expect neural networks to always give perfect answers, humans certainly don&#39;t with our very very advanced neural networks, but we can perhaps expect them to come closer. A more likely route to me though is using agents for something like this, the neural network simply has to understand that &quot;this question can be solved by a calculator&quot;, and then call an external calculator function which can do the calculation in a deterministic and much more efficient way.<br><br>In a similar way, perhaps we could have e.g. physics agents which the neural network can interact with in order to get the simulation right. It&#39;s not like humans are great at imagining the exact physics of e.g. gravity without actually calculating the path an object would take.\"\n",

It&#39;s patterns are heuristics, and since there&#39;s this common root across domains that we know of, zooming in and out of scopes and of any type is possible. Heuristics are heuristics because they apply to every level of our own universe (in their concentration)... it&#39;s just the process of gleaning or deducing and then isolating and proofing, it gradually becomes and  immutable truth.<br><br>What&#39;s even weirder about all of our human active systems, is we learn these things innately,  years and years before we can even begin to define them at their essential parts. You learn what the force of gravity is within a month or two and how to exert yourself on it/with it. You understand the way light works within about that same time... but it took centuries of generations before a human actually proved these things out mathematically.
